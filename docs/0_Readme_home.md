# Community Hub

We believe that flexibility is key to effective evasion and threat emulation. Cobalt Strike gives users the power to adapt—whether by tweaking malleable C2 profiles or going deeper with full customizations using our Arsenal Kit and Public Templates and Examples.

Whether you're modifying configurations or building custom implementations, you have the freedom to shape every stage of the attack chain.

One thing that sets Cobalt Strike apart from other C2 frameworks is its user community – not only the size of the community, but also its level of engagement. Contribute to the Community Hub! 

Contributing works as follows:

- Pull requests can be submitted into the Community Kit repository.
- Want to share info on a specific topic that is not yet in the Community Hub? Create new ```.md``` file in the ```docs``` folder and link it from the index.html page functionality in the left menu bar.

All contributions will be reviewed before publishing.

Together, we harness collective expertise to provide you with cutting-edge intelligence and best-practices for your engagements and research.
