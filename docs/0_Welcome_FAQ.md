# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## How can I contribute to the project?

You can **share your knowledge** or **fix defects** in the Community Hub. Contributing works as follows:

- Pull requests can be submitted into the [Community Kit repository](https://github.com/Cobalt-Strike/community_kit/).
- Want to share info on a specific topic that is not yet in the Community Hub? Create new ```.md``` file in the ```docs``` folder and link it from the index.html page functionality in the left menu bar.

All **contributions will be reviewed** before publishing.

Together, we harness collective expertise to provide you with cutting-edge intelligence and best-practices for your engagements and research.
